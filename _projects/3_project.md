As large-scale online experiments are becoming increasingly configurable and adaptive, they blur the line between behavioral paradigms and computer algorithms. This perspective (sometimes referred to as <emph>Algorithms with People</emph>) inspires a new class of paradigms for characterizing representations. By treating representations as subjective probabilities we can design behavioral experiments that instantiate sampling algorithms from those representations. I have been involved in multiple projects that develop and leverage such paradigms for studying semantic and perceptual representations in humans and machines, including (i) Gibbs Sampling with People {% cite NEURIPS2020_7880d722 marjieh2024timbral kumar2022using %}, (ii) STEP-Tag {% cite marjieh2023words PPR:PPR831252 %}, and (iii) Multimodal serial reproduction {% cite pmlr-v202-marjieh23a kumar2024comparing %}. For a recent summary of this approach, check out this book chapter that we recently wrote {% cite warwick180242 %}.
