Music is a perfect domain for studying cognitive representations due to its dominant role in our daily experiences. Whether you are trying to sing back a melody, decide if you like a new musical chord, or figure out if what you just heard was a song, your mind is applying complex processing to make sense of this rich sensory input. I am very interested in characterizing such processes and the cognitive representations that support them by leveraging large-scale adaptive experiments and computational models. Some of the projects that I work on in this domain include: (i) Psychoacoustic theories of consonance {% cite marjieh2024timbral %}, (ii) Musical pitch representations {% cite marjieh2024timbral %}, and (iii) Rational accounts of the speech-to-song illusion {% cite marjieh2024rational %}.
