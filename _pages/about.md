I'm a PhD candidate at [Princeton Psychology][https://psychology.princeton.edu/] working in the Griffiths [Computational Cognitive Science Lab][https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php]. I also collaborate closely with the [Cornell Computational Cognition Lab][https://www.norijacoby.com/cococo.html].

Prior to that I completed an MSc in Physics, and a joint BSc in Physics and Electrical Engineering at the [Technion][https://www.technion.ac.il/en/].
